# Adding the extension to your VsCode. 
## Run the command ```cp -r alfa ~/.vscode/extensions``` from ./
I ran the command from \desktop\newalfahighlighting

# You need to reload the vscode window or close and reopen vscode after running the command.
## You should now see 'alfa' under extensions in vscode.
